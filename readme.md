For Developers
--------------
I have updated the entire plane, it now sports the following new features:

 * Livery support
 * Dark gray interior (If you don't like it, the old model is included as `Models/pa24-250.ac.bak`)
 * Added noise to the panel texture, and a V-Speeds chart next to the parking brake handle.


For Flyers
----------
Download the zip and extract it into your flightgear aircraft directory. Then rename the folder from `pa24-250-master` to `pa24-250`. You should be good to go!

Todo
----
 * Add immatriculation support
